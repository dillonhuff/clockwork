This is version 5.22 of the Polyhedral Library.
http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/polylib


REQUIREMENTS:
=============
All you need to build the polylib is a C compiler like gcc.

If you want the library to be overflow proof, you might install
the GNU-MP library, version 2.0.2 or more. You can get it from:
       ftp://ftp.gnu.org
or from any GNU mirror site.
You should run './configure --with-libgmp' to use gmp.

You can also build the polylib if you don't have gmp, but it will
fail when an overflow occurs.


BUILDING, if you have root access:
=================================
1. Run ./configure
2. Become root
3. Run 'make install'
4. Run 'make test' to test the library on a given set of examples
5. Run 'make longtest' to run a longer test on the examples


BUILDING, if you don't have root access (WITHOUT INSTALLING THE LIB)
====================================================================
Run './configure --disable-install-lib' at step 1.
The executables will be built in the Obj.*.* directory, linked with
the static library.
You can run the tests after 'make' in this case.

INSTALLING THE LIB IN A PRIVATE DIRECTORY
=========================================
Run './configure --prefix=MyDirectory'

I suggest that you also add option '--enable-onlystatic'. It does not
make much sense to build a shared object in a private directory.
If you do however, you will have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
using the lib.

OTHER OPTIONS
=============
Type './configure --help' to get a complete list of options supported
by the configure script.

If something fails, send me an e-report: loechner@icps.u-strasbg.fr
