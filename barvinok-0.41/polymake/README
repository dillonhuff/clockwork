Minimal polymake client.

Compile and install both barvinok and polymake first.

Specify the directory containing the polymake Makefile
with --with-polymake=/path/to/polymake 
Make sure you have installed the Makefile (make install-devel).

If the barvinok library is installed in a non-standard location,
you may need to specifiy the path of the directory containing
barvinok.pc (usually $prefix/lib/pkgconfig) in the PKG_CONFIG
environment variable.
If you specify the installation directory of barvinok
with --with-barvinok=/path/to/barvinok, configure will do this for you.
