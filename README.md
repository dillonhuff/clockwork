# Clockwork: Polyhedral Analysis for Hardware Accelerators

Clockwork is a tool for compiling naive descriptions of hardware accelerators written as loop nests into high performance, staticall scheduled hardware.

## Important Files
* `build_set_test.cpp` - The main driver program
* `ubuffer.h` - The header file which stores the `UBuffer` class, which represents re-use buffers that store data between compute operations.
* `prog.h` - The header file which stores the `prog` class, which is the clockwork input representation.

## Dependencies

Examples of how to install the dependencies can be found in [./misc/install\_deps\_mac.sh](./misc/install_deps_mac.sh) and [./misc/install\_deps\_linux.sh](./misc/install\_deps\_linux.sh).

Please install the specific versions of the listed dependencies. Do
not just take the latest release on NTL or barvinok.

* ntl-11.4.1 - [download here](https://shoup.net/ntl/download.html) 
    * https://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-unix.html (needs GMP to be installed already)
* barvinok-0.41 - [download here](http://barvinok.gforge.inria.fr/)
   * https://repo.or.cz/w/barvinok.git/blob/HEAD:/README - instructions for installing barvinok with ntl and GMP
   * note that linux users may need to manually add -lpthread to the LIBS field (change "LIBS = -lntl -lgmp", to "LIBS = -lpthread -lntl -lgmp")
* *optional codegen backend* **CoreIR** - [github link](https://github.com/rdaly525/coreir.git)

# Building an example 

To generate a synthesizable accelerator which blurs a 1920 x 1080 grayscale image:

    ./rebuild_and_run.sh blur-example

This will write HLS code for the accelerator and several different test drivers for it to `./blur_example`. To run a software emulation of the accelerator do:

    clang++ -std=c++11 ./blur_example/blur_example_opt_sw_bmp_test_harness.cpp ./blur_example/blur_example_opt.cpp -I ./aws_collateral/ -I .
    ./a.out

This will run the accelerator in simulation on a `bmp` image and write the output to `blur_example_opt_bmp_out.bmp`.

# Running all tests

* Default build and execute script which will execute all tests:

    `./rebuild_and_run.sh`

* Optional build with CoreIR backend

    `export COREIR_PATH=/path/to/coreir`
    
    `make -j COREIR=1`

The file `build_set_test.cpp` is the main driver for all tests.
Most files in this repository are automatically generated collateral
that can be ignored.
