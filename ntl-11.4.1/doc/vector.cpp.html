<span class="Comment">MODULE: vector</span>

<span class="Comment">SUMMARY:</span>

<span class="Comment">Template class for dynamic-sized vectors.</span>

<span class="Comment">The declaration</span>

<span class="Comment">   Vec&lt;T&gt; v;</span>

<span class="Comment">creates a zero-length vector.  To grow this vector to length n,</span>
<span class="Comment">execute</span>

<span class="Comment">   v.SetLength(n)</span>

<span class="Comment">This causes space to be allocated for (at least) n elements, and also causes</span>
<span class="Comment">the default constructor for T to be called to initialize these elements.</span>

<span class="Comment">The current length of a vector is available as v.length().</span>

<span class="Comment">Let n = v.length().  Calling v.SetLength(m) with m &lt;= n sets the current length</span>
<span class="Comment">of v to m (but does not call any destructors or free any space).  Calling</span>
<span class="Comment">v.SetLength(m) with m &gt; n will allocate space and initialize as necessary, but</span>
<span class="Comment">will leave the values of the already allocated elements unchanged (although</span>
<span class="Comment">their addresses may change).  If T has a user-defined default constructor, that</span>
<span class="Comment">is invoked.  Otherwise, the new memory locations are &quot;default initialized&quot;.  In</span>
<span class="Comment">particular, this means that POD types may be uninitialized.</span>

<span class="Comment">v.MaxLength() is the largest value of n for which v.SetLength(n) was invoked,</span>
<span class="Comment">and is equal to the number of entries that have been initialized.</span>
<span class="Comment">v.SetMaxLength(n) will allocate space for and initialize up to n elements,</span>
<span class="Comment">without changing v.length().</span>

<span class="Comment">When v's destructor is called, all constructed elements will be destructed, and</span>
<span class="Comment">all space will be relinquished.</span>

<span class="Comment">v.allocated() is the number of elements which have been allocated,</span>
<span class="Comment">which may be more than the number elements initialized.</span>
<span class="Comment">Note that if n &lt;= v.allocated(), then v.SetLength(n) is guaranteed</span>
<span class="Comment">not to cause any memory allocation or movement of objects.</span>

<span class="Comment">Space is managed using malloc, realloc, and free.  When a vector is grown, a</span>
<span class="Comment">bit more space may be allocated than was requested for efficiency reasons.</span>

<span class="Comment">Note that when a vector is grown, the objects in the vector may have moved,</span>
<span class="Comment">possibly creating dangling references to vector elements.  One has to be</span>
<span class="Comment">especially careful of this when using vectors passed as reference parameters</span>
<span class="Comment">that may alias one another.</span>


<span class="Comment">----------------------</span>
<span class="Comment">IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</span>
<span class="Comment">----------------------</span>

<span class="Comment">A Vec&lt;T&gt; object is just a pointer to the first element of the array.  There is</span>
<span class="Comment">a control block immediately before the first element that keeps track of</span>
<span class="Comment">several parameters: </span>
<span class="Comment">   len    -- the logical length of the array (returned by length())</span>
<span class="Comment">   init   -- the number of elements constructed (returned ny MaxLength())</span>
<span class="Comment">   alloc  -- the number of elements for which space has been allocated</span>
<span class="Comment">             (returned by allocated())</span>
<span class="Comment">   fixed  -- flag that indicates that the length is fixed </span>
<span class="Comment">             (returned by fixed())</span>

<span class="Comment">Note that 0 &lt;= len &lt;= init &lt;- alloc</span>



<span class="Comment">---------------</span>
<span class="Comment">SPECIALIZATIONS</span>
<span class="Comment">---------------</span>

<span class="Comment">NTL currently defines an optimized specialization Vec&lt;GF2&gt;.  There are a few</span>
<span class="Comment">quirks to be aware of.  See the documentation file for vec_GF2 for more</span>
<span class="Comment">details.</span>


<span class="Comment">---------------------</span>
<span class="Comment">RANGE-BASED FOR LOOPS</span>
<span class="Comment">---------------------</span>

<span class="Comment">NTL's vectors provide sufficient functionality to enable range-based for-loops</span>
<span class="Comment">(in C++11).  The safest ways to use this functionality are to write:</span>

<span class="Comment">   for (auto&amp;&amp; item : vec) { ... } // for read-only or read/write access</span>

<span class="Comment">or</span>

<span class="Comment">   for (T item : vec) { ... } // for access via a copy</span>

<span class="Comment">This is especially true if vec may be of type Vec&lt;GF2&gt;.  Again, see the</span>
<span class="Comment">documentation file for vec_GF2 for more details.</span>


<span class="Comment">--------------</span>
<span class="Comment">OTHER FEATURES</span>
<span class="Comment">--------------</span>

<span class="Comment">The i-th vector element (counting from 0) is accessed as v[i].  If the macro</span>
<span class="Comment">NTL_RANGE_CHECK is defined, code is emitted to test if 0 &lt;= i &lt; v.length().</span>
<span class="Comment">This check is not performed by default.</span>

<span class="Comment">For old-time FORTRAN programmers, the i-th vector element (counting from 1) is</span>
<span class="Comment">accessed as v(i).</span>

<span class="Comment">--------------------</span>
<span class="Comment">REALLOCATION DETAILS</span>
<span class="Comment">--------------------</span>

<span class="Comment">When a vector is resized and not enough space has been allocated, then a</span>
<span class="Comment">reallocation process takes place.  There are several strategies which can be</span>
<span class="Comment">used, which we list here from least to most efficient.</span>


<span class="Comment">COPY AND DESTROY STRATEGY:</span>
<span class="Comment">This is the same strategy used by the STL prior to C++11.  New memory is</span>
<span class="Comment">allocated, and each element of the vector is copied (using a copy constructor)</span>
<span class="Comment">to the new memory, and then all the elements in the old memory is destroyed</span>
<span class="Comment">(using a destructor).  While much safer than the Realloc Strategy, it can be a</span>
<span class="Comment">bit slower.</span>

<span class="Comment">MOVE STRATEGY:</span>
<span class="Comment">This is a strategy that is also used by the STL, assuming C++11.  New memory is</span>
<span class="Comment">allocated, and each element of the vector is moved (using a move constructor)</span>
<span class="Comment">to the new memory, and then all the elements in the old memory is destroyed</span>
<span class="Comment">(using a destructor).  This strategy is only viable if the underlying type has</span>
<span class="Comment">a &quot;nothrow&quot; move constructor.  Typically, it will be significantly faster than</span>
<span class="Comment">the Copy and Destroy Strategy.</span>

<span class="Comment">REALLOC STRATEGY:</span>
<span class="Comment">This strategy simply calls the realloc function, which may result in objects</span>
<span class="Comment">being copied bit-wise from one location in memory to another.  For most types</span>
<span class="Comment">of objects, even those with non-trivial constructors and destructors, this is</span>
<span class="Comment">perfectly safe, as most objects really don't care what address they are stored</span>
<span class="Comment">at.  As an example of where this doesn't work, STL string implementations using</span>
<span class="Comment">a &quot;short string&quot; optimization may consist of an object containing a pointer to</span>
<span class="Comment">a sub-object, which would be invalidated if the object were bit-wise moved from</span>
<span class="Comment">one location to another.  This strategy is the fastest of them all.</span>

<span class="Comment">CHOOSING A STRATEGY:</span>
<span class="Comment">In the implementation of Vec&lt;T&gt;, NTL will opt for the Realloc Strategy</span>
<span class="Comment">if one of the two conditions hold:</span>
<span class="Comment">   (i) T has a trivial copy constructor and a trivial destructor, or</span>
<span class="Comment">   (iii) T is a class that has been explicit declared &quot;relocatable&quot;.</span>
<span class="Comment">(See below for details on how to declare that a class is relocatable.)</span>
<span class="Comment">Otherwise, NTL will use the Move Strategy if T has a nothrow move costructor.</span>
<span class="Comment">Otherwise, NTL will use the Copy Strategy if T has a copy constructor that is</span>
<span class="Comment">accessible (i.e., not private and not deleted).  Otherwise, no reallocation</span>
<span class="Comment">implementation is provided, and a runtime error will be raised if a</span>
<span class="Comment">reallocation is required (this provides maximum flexiblilty and also maximum</span>
<span class="Comment">backward compatibility with previous versions of NTL, even though sometimes a</span>
<span class="Comment">compile-time diagnostic would be preferable).</span>


<span class="Comment">DECLARING A CLASS RELOCATABLE:</span>
<span class="Comment">One can declare T to be relocatable by adding the following line of code</span>
<span class="Comment">immediately after the definition of class T:</span>

<span class="Comment">   NTL_DECLARE_RELOCATABLE((T*))</span>

<span class="Comment">Notice the double parentheses and the &quot;*&quot; --- these are unfortunately </span>
<span class="Comment">necessary.  This macro expands as </span>

<span class="Comment">   constexpr bool DeclareRelocatableType(T*) { return true; }</span>

<span class="Comment">Inside the class Vec&lt;T&gt;, this function is invoked with ((T*) 0) as the</span>
<span class="Comment">argument.  By declaring relocatability via a function definition in this way,</span>
<span class="Comment">the Vec&lt;T&gt; class will always find (via &quot;Koenig lookup&quot;, or ADL) the declaration</span>
<span class="Comment">for T in the namespace in which T is defined (assuming you put the</span>
<span class="Comment">relocatability declaration there as well).</span>

<span class="Comment">You can also declare a template class to be relocatable, as in:</span>

<span class="Comment">   template&lt;class X, class Y&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   NTL_DECLARE_RELOCATABLE((T&lt;X,Y&gt;*))</span>

<span class="Comment">There is also a macro NTL_DECLARE_RELOCATABLE_WHEN, which leaves off the</span>
<span class="Comment">function body, if you want something other than { return true; }</span>

<span class="Comment">NTL also defines template functions:</span>

<span class="Comment">   template&lt;class T&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   constexpr bool DeclareRelocatableType(T*) </span>
<span class="Comment">   { return ... ;  }</span>

<span class="Comment">where &quot;...&quot; is an expression that returns true if T is a simple type that is</span>
<span class="Comment">safe to relocate, as determined by C++11 type traits.  Such simple types</span>
<span class="Comment">include scalar types and simple classes with trivial copy constructor and</span>
<span class="Comment">destructor.</span>

<span class="Comment">NTL already declares as relocatable most if the fundamental types fot which it</span>
<span class="Comment">makes sense to do so.</span>

<span class="Comment">UNSAFE VECTOR MODE:</span>
<span class="Comment">The above describes the default behavior of NTL as of version 11.0.  Prior to</span>
<span class="Comment">version 11.0, the default behavior was to only use the Realloc Strategy, which</span>
<span class="Comment">is potentially unsafe.  You can revert to this old behavior by configuring</span>
<span class="Comment">NTL_SAFE_VECTORS=off.</span>


<span class="Comment">-------------------------</span>
<span class="Comment">COMPARISON TO STL VECTORS </span>
<span class="Comment">-------------------------</span>

<span class="Comment">When the length of an NTL vector is reduced, no objects are destroyed.</span>
<span class="Comment">In contrast, when the length of an STL vector is reduced, objects are</span>
<span class="Comment">destroyed (effectively, maintaining the invariant len == init).</span>

<span class="Comment">Also, STL vectors never use anything like the Realloc Strategy.</span>


<span class="Comment">----------------------</span>
<span class="Comment">HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</span>
<span class="Comment">----------------------</span>

<span class="Comment">When I first started working on NTL around 1990, C++ was a much simpler</span>
<span class="Comment">language.  Among other things, there were no templates and no STL, so the Vec</span>
<span class="Comment">class started out (and remained, for many years) a set of macros (indeed, this</span>
<span class="Comment">approach was advocated in the first edition of Stroustrup's book).</span>

<span class="Comment">My thinking at that time was very much &quot;C oriented&quot;.  The idea of resizing a</span>
<span class="Comment">vector without using realloc never occured to me, and all of the classes I</span>
<span class="Comment">wanted to put in vectors were relocatable.  Why would you ever bother making</span>
<span class="Comment">copies of vector elements and destroy the originals when you could just</span>
<span class="Comment">realloc?  It wasn't until many years later that I even realized this was</span>
<span class="Comment">somehow questionable practice.  Indeed, resizing via malloc is technically</span>
<span class="Comment">undefined behavior, but it's been working for me for over 25 years without</span>
<span class="Comment">problems.</span>

<span class="Comment">Furthermore, because of the poor performance of malloc in those days (which is</span>
<span class="Comment">much better now), I designed the Vec&lt;ZZ_p&gt; class (and a few others) to allocate</span>
<span class="Comment">the underlying ZZ's in blocks.  This not only reduces the number of calls to</span>
<span class="Comment">malloc, but it also gives better locality of reference.  Experiments in the</span>
<span class="Comment">last couple of years show that this is still benefit to doing this.</span>

<span class="Comment">With all of these design decisions baked into NTL's Vec class, transitioning to</span>
<span class="Comment">STL vectors would be problematic, and is unlikely to ever happen.  But as</span>
<span class="Comment">things have evolved, NTL Vec's offers many of the same convenience and safety</span>
<span class="Comment">features as STL vector's.</span>

<span class="Comment">Esoteric: skip on first reading...also these interfaces are subject to change</span>

<span class="Comment">When new elements in a vector need to be constructed, one of the</span>
<span class="Comment">following routines is called:</span>

<span class="Comment">   void BlockConstruct(T* p, long n); </span>
<span class="Comment">   // invokes T() to initialize p[i] for i = 0..n-1</span>

<span class="Comment">   void BlockConstructFromVec(T* p, long n, const T* q);</span>
<span class="Comment">   // invokes T(q[i]) to initialize p[i] for i = 0..n-1;</span>

<span class="Comment">   void BlockConstructFromObj(T* p, long n, const T&amp; q);</span>
<span class="Comment">   // invokes T(q) to initialize p[i] for i = 0..n-1</span>


<span class="Comment">When a vector is destroyed, the following routine is called:</span>

<span class="Comment">   void BlockDestroy(T* p, long n);</span>
<span class="Comment">   // invokes ~T() on p[i] for i = 0..n-1</span>

<span class="Comment">The default behavior of these routines may be modified by </span>
<span class="Comment">overloading these functions with a custom implementation.</span>

<span class="Comment">EXCEPTIONS:</span>
<span class="Comment">In order to provide exception safe code, the Construct routines</span>
<span class="Comment">should provide strong ES; in particular, if any constructor</span>
<span class="Comment">throws, all newly constructed objects should be destroyed.</span>
<span class="Comment">Moreover, the BlockDestroy routine should not throw at all.</span>


<span class="Comment">In NTL, these routines are overridden for the ZZ_p and GF2E classes,</span>
<span class="Comment">so that many vector entries will be packed into contiguous storage</span>
<span class="Comment">locations.  This reduces the number of invocations of malloc, and</span>
<span class="Comment">increases locality of reference.</span>
